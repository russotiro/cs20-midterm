    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
    <br/>
    <div class="bus"><img src="OG_bus.jpg"></div>
    <div>OUR FOUNDER: GUS DORNER
    <p>Gus was born in Saugus, MA, in 1951, just outside of Boston city limits.
         He grew up constantly traveling in and out of the city faced with 
         heavy traffic and poor drivers. It was then that Gus decided to help
         those not familiar to the area traverse it with ease. He founded Gus's
         Buses in 1985 with only a small bus and a single driver. Over the next
         20 years, he would grow and expand Gus's Buses into what it has become
         today. In his life, he was known for his dedication to both his family
         and his company. Gus retired in 2015 to spend more time with his wife
         and kids.Today his legacy is carried by his two sons who are 
         continuing the family business in their father's name.</p></div>
